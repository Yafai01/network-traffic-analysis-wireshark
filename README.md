# 🔐 Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a practical demonstration of capturing and analyzing live network traffic using **Wireshark**.  
The project focuses on identifying common network protocols and understanding how data flows across a network in real time.

This work was completed as part of a **Cyber Security Internship** to build hands-on skills in packet capture, protocol analysis, and network troubleshooting.

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Installed Wireshark and selected the active Wi-Fi interface.
2. Captured live network traffic for a short duration.
3. Generated traffic by browsing websites and pinging a public server.
4. Stopped the capture and applied display filters.
5. Analyzed packets based on different protocols.
6. Saved the capture as a `.pcap` file.
7. Documented observations and findings.

## 🌐 Protocols Identified
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
  Resolves domain names into IP addresses.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
  Ensures reliable and ordered data transmission.

- **HTTPS / TLS**  
  Provides encrypted and secure communication over the web.
